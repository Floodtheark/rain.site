# Noah Pepe & $RAIN – The Rainmaker Ark 🌧️🛳️🐸

Welcome to the official source code for the one-page site behind **$RAIN**, the meme coin with a mission. This is where frogs take shelter, devs stay present, and rugs get washed away in a flood of transparency.

## 🌧️ What is $RAIN?

$RAIN is a meme coin launched on Solana with:

- **0% mint, 1.5% tax**
- **0.75% dev tax** (transparent, capped selling)
- **0.75% community allocation** (contests, LP, burns)
- A vibe-driven, community-powered mission
- CT narrative, meme-fueled storytelling

## 🧾 Dev Tax Rules

Every transaction incurs 1.5% tax:
- 0.75% goes to the dev wallet, sold *no more than once per $25K volume milestone*
- 0.75% goes to contests, liquidity, and burns — depending on phase
- All tokens launched via pump.fun with **no rug switches**

## 🛳️ What's On This Page?

This is a simple static site:
- Built in pure HTML/CSS (no framework)
- Fully mobile-responsive
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
